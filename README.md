  * This comprehensive, proven text offers a logical, simple system for learning medical vocabulary primarily by building terms from word parts. It first introduces medical terminology and its essential suffixes and prefixes; then guides students logically through each key body system, working from the outside (integumentary system) inward, and from simple systems to complex. Additional specialty chapters cover oncology, radiology and nuclear medicine, and mental health. Updated throughout, this Seventh Edition’s many new learning features include: “at-a-glance” A&P tables; tables of combining forms with meanings; color-coded word parts; new labeling exercises; and 17 new practical applications using realistic medical records.
